# 📚 Volunteer Teaching Recordings by Najiyya Younas
## Volunteer JavaScript Instructor | Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences 

Welcome to my repository of teaching recordings! As a passionate software engineer and volunteer instructor, I’m thrilled to share my JavaScript teaching resources with you. Currently, I’m teaching beginners at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. This repository will continue to evolve as I add more content and workshops.

🎯 Teaching Experience
I’m offering free volunteer workshops aimed at helping beginners dive into the world of JavaScript. Whether you're new to coding or looking to solidify your knowledge, these recordings are designed to help you grow your skills and gain confidence.

As a full-time software engineer, my commitment to teaching allows me to give back to the community and develop my skills as an educator.
